# lua-thrift

LuaRocks packaging of [Apache Thrift](https://thrift.apache.org).

## TODO

Can't figure out how to prevent pack from storing ALL of what's in git (put only lib/lua)

## Building

```bash
#folder structure is different, do not try #luarocks build
luarocks pack rockspecs/thrift-0.17.0-4.rockspec
```

[Result](thrift-0.17.0-3.src.rock)

## Upload

Somewhere

## Installation

```bash
luarocks install https://somewhere/thrift-0.17.0-4.src.rock
```
